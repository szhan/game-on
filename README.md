# game-on

This repo contains very lightweight wrappers to the Riot Games API. It supports only version 3, as version 2 is about to be deprecated at the time of coding. The full documentation of the API is here: https://developer.riotgames.com/.

The goal is to develop this into an API to facilitate studies in social dynamics using League of Legends game data.

It is assumed that a file named 'API_KEY', which contains the user API key, is in the main directory.
